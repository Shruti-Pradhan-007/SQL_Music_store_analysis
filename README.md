# SQL_Music_store_analysis

In this SQL project, I have analysed the data from a music store and answered questions by drawing insights regarding the spending pattern of customers, how much money theyâ€™ve spent, which tracks have been sold the most, which artist have made it to the top 10 list, which country has generated the most sales for the store and several other questions that would help the business owner in further scaling up his venture and thus be able to reward his most loyal customers as well top-selling artists.

I have used MySQL Workbench and created the database in my local machine to carry forward with the analysis.

The schema diagram for the database is available under the Wiki page.
